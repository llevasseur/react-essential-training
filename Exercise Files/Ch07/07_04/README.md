# Chapter 7 Lesson 4
Nesting links with React Router v6

Learned how to create child pages, like for our About component. Nest routes in index.js.
In the App component, import Outlet from react-router-dom. Outlet is like a little container that's going to display nested components.

Put an Outlet component where you want in the component you want your nested route to exist.

Nested routes are fundamentally different than the parent route, so you can create page hierarchies within our application.
