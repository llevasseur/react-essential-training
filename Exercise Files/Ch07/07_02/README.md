# Chapter 7 Lesson 2

Configuring the Router in React.

Learned the first step to configure the Router is to go to index.js and import BrowserRouter from react-router-dom. Also import Routes and Route.

Wrap the App component in a BrowserRouter, and set up a Routes wrapper inside, then place Route tags in there. The path for the home page is / and the element is the App component.

Set up a Route for About, but make sure to export it from App!
