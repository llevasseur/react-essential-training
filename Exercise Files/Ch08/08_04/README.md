# Chapter 9 Lesson 5

Deploying to Netlify

Learned about and connected my github to Netlify. I clicked add site and added my built app from lesson 4.

To build an app, run npm run build. This is going to create production build for our application, meaning that this will be optimized for production; it will have everything ready to go. This will generate the build folder. Drag the build folder to Netlify.

Netlify provides you with a free domain to your built app!!!
