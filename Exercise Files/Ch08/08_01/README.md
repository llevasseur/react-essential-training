# Chapter 8 Lesson 1
Using Create React App as a testing platform.

Learned about the built in feature: npm test. It runs any tests that exist in the app, and can be used as an alternative to npm start!

Runs App.test.js, but it will run anything with the .test.js extension. Something needs to be in the file to be run.
