# Chapter 5 Lesson 2
Creating controlled form elements

Learned to set a state from an onChange event from a form input. When using an onChange event, pass the event argument into the function and get the value from the form input using the event argument: event.target.value.

Whenever we see a state variable being used for a form, we now know this to be a controlled form.
