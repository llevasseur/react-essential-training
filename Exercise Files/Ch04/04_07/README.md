# Chapter 4 Lesson 7
Incorporating useReducer into React

Learned how to make a checkbox to manage useState with useEffect.
Also, how to use the onChange method with a input tag with type checkbox.

Learned about a different hook function called useReducer. Takes in two different arguments, the first is the function we will use to update our state, and the second is going to be our initial state.

This looks a lot like python where the first, second = second, first. setChecked is the second, and is the first argument. UseReducer does what useState does but takes in a function to set the state. Any time we call the setChecked, the results are going to be the same!
