# Chapter 4 Lesson 3
Destructing arrays and objects

Learned how to deal with state of our application by Destructing. Simply request for keys from the properties rather than the dictionary itself in the component.

We can also destruct arrays; instead of naming a list with a value, you can use a list. Each item in the list will represent the indexed item in the list.
