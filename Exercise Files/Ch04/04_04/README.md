Understanding the useState hook in React

Learned that useState function is the most modern way to manage states in an app.

useState consists of two values, a "state" value that is undefined to begin with, and a function that we can use to update the state.

Set a state by passing a value to it. Save the state and the function to a destructed list!

Learned how to create a button with the button tag, and link a function to the onClick method.

When you change a state, it will change the state for the entire app.
